# CHANGELOG
## [0.11.0] - 2017-10-04
### Added
- The artefacts module now has a method to get files from .tar.gz archives.  To make use of this
  artefact classes must expose a variable named extension (see the code for artefacts.Textfile for
  an example.

- pipeline.run() now optionally accepts a Sentry.IO client that will be used to log exceptions.


## [0.10.2] - 2017-04-12
### Added
- The SQLDatabase recorder can now store the entire result dictionary to e.g. a
  JSONB column in a PostgreSQL database.


## [0.10.1] - 2017-03-07
### Changed
- pytest is now used instead of py.test where applicable.
- Functions decorated with @record can now be used outside a pipeline.


## [0.10.0] - 2017-01-09
### Added
- Artefacts will now check whether their file exists on initialization and
  raise an exception if it doesn't (this hcheck can be disabled).

### Changed
- Now passes pydocstyle checks.
- The VERSION file is now the single source for the version number in
  documentation, __version__ and setup.py.


## [0.9.0] - 2016-12-12
### Changed
- Calls made by recorded functions are now stored and serialized as lists so that functions using 
  multiple commands are correctly described.


## [0.8.0] - 2016-12-07
### Changed
- Renamed Artefact.basename to Artefact.justname and modified Artefact.basename to include 
  directory components.


## [0.7.0] - 2016-11-17
### Changed
- Wheels are now built for Python 2 and 3.
- JSON pipeline report is now saved to report.json.  This can be changed by
  supplying the report_name keyword argument to Pipeline.run().  Fixing the name
  makes automated reading data from the report later easier.
- Keyword arguments to recorded functions are now saved correctly.


## [0.6.5] - 2016-11-08
